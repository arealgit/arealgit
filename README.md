- 👋 Hi, I’m @arealgit
- 👀 I’m building a repository of JavaScript, Python, Powershell, and Bash which should be helpful for ITSM and device management.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot at once. I've begun to study for the PMP exam and am learning and practicing Agile software development. I'm learning advanced programming techniques and am beginning to imagine my own projects. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any of the above, or projects relating to guitar, drums, skateboarding, cycling, gardening, traveling, or building and construction. 
- 📫 How to reach me: anthonyshec@gmail.com
